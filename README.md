Composite Driver for GoGoGate2 management in Hubitat

Progression:
- Started with basic composite plugin framework from https://github.com/dpark/Hubitat-Composite-Driver
- Relied heavily on https://github.com/bmergner/bcsmart/tree/Sensor-Update for polling logic, URIs and the parse function
- Used log output control from https://github.com/stephack/Hubitat/blob/master/drivers/Lifx%20Group%20of%20Groups/Lifx%20GoG.groovy
